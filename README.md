# Traumatic Brain Injury

This study aimed to explore the impact of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on the volume of the hippocampus and its changes over time while also examining how cognitive recovery (especially language comprehension) varies with age and gender differences.

## Methodology
  - Participants: Data analysis involved 155 participants, including 94 patients and 61 control group members.
  - Analysis Techniques: Linear mixed-effects models were used to handle repeated measures in the dataset. Wald tests were applied to assess the impact of various factors.

## Results
  - Compared to the control group, the patient group exhibited a significant downward trend in hippocampal volume post-injury.
  - Gender influences the process of hippocampal volume change, with males experiencing a faster rate of decline as they age.
  - Age is highly more significant for males compared to females. (A 50-year-old female patient has a similar left hippocampus volume size as a male in his late 20's.)
  - A significant positive correlation between gray matter volume and the left hippocampus volume was found, highlighting the role of gray matter in supporting hippocampal functions, especially in language and memory formation.

## Conclusion
These findings underscore the importance of understanding the impact of TBI on hippocampal volume and cognitive function, particularly regarding gender differences, age and the role of gray matter.
