# Traumatic Brain Injury
This study aimed to explore the impact of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on the volume of the
hippocampus and its changes over time while also examining how cognitive recovery
(especially language comprehension) varies with age and gender differences. Through detailed
data analysis of 155 participants (including 94 patients and 21 control group members), we
used linear mixed-effects models to handle repeated measures in the dataset and applied Wald
tests to assess the impact of various factors.
The results show that compared to the control group, patient group exhibited a significant
downward trend in hippocampal volume after injury. However, this rate of decrease did not
significantly differ from the control group over time. Additionally, the analysis found that
gender might influence the process of hippocampal volume change, particularly with males
experiencing a faster rate of decline in hippocampal volume as they age. Further analysis
revealed a significant positive correlation between gray matter volume and the volume of the
left hippocampus, suggesting the crucial role of gray matter in supporting hippocampal
functions, especially in language and memory formation.
